1. Python Language Translator
    By making use of python library called "googletrans" , we are able to translate the given source text into required language.
    Googletrans is a free and unlimited python library that implements Google Translate API. This uses the Google Translate Ajax API to make calls to such methods                 as detect and translate.
    Further from "googletrans" library , we import traslator and create object of translator to make use of google translate ajax api.
